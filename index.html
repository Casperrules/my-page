        <p class="decription">
          Hi! This is Adarsh, again. I am an application developer and I develop
          apps for fun. I basically love to code, create python liberaries for
          interesting DSA problems which also inclined me towards competetive
          programming problems.
        </p>
        
        <p class="description">
          Following are the techs I have worked on:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Python:-</strong> python has beenmy favourite language since I started learning programming 4 years ago. I have also been an instructor for advance python courses. The first web framework I learned was in python(flask and later Django). I also learned creating UIs in python and obviously data science, data visualization and machine learning</li>
            <li><strong>Java:-</strong> Java was the second favourite language I had after python. I have worked with creating Java based applications and connecting them to sql databases to create a nice attractive desktop application. I also trained in Java and cleared the Java associate certificate from microsoft. </li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:-</strong> javaScript is probably the most used language by me, used for creating web applications, I later turned to typeScript but well "potato, better potato" right?</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript:-</strong> typeScript is a recent language for me but since I am quite familiar with javaScript, the shift to typeScript was really not that hard.</li>
            <li><strong>Databases:-</strong> data in today's world is the most important asset and handling data becomes very cruicial for efficient performance of applications.m I have worked on both <strong>SQL</strong>(mySQL, Oracle SQL database)and <strong>NOSQL</strong>(mongoDB) type databases.</li>
            <li><strong>REACT:-</strong> Well, talking about some useful liberaries, React is the most useful one I have used (with typeScript and javaScript). The process of frontend dev becomes so much easier with REACT</li>
            <li><strong>Angular:-</strong> The angular framework, helps handelling frontend development easy too but the dataflow becomes sometimes confusing to me. I liked angular but I preffer React</li>
            <li><strong>REST API:-</strong> I have been creating fullstack applications for about a year now. I love the way creating APIs make the backend so easy to handle and manageable. Most of the backends I create are using <strong>Express</strong> on Node.</li>
          </ul>
